# Data-Wrangling-project

## Introduction:

This project focused on wrangling data from the WeRateDogs Twitter account using Python, documented in a Jupyter Notebook (wrangle_act.ipynb). This Twitter account rates dogs with humorous commentary. The rating denominator is usually 10, however, the numerators are usually greater than 10. This aspect was not cleaned as it is part of the humor and popularity of WeRateDogs.

For this project I used three data sets that we combined together later in one dataframe.
1- twitter archive data
2- image predation data
3- json data

The goal of the project was to wrangle the dataset and create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. In order to achieve that we had to request the Twitter API and collect additional data for the provided WeRateDogs tweets. Furthermore, another dataset which contained image predictions of a trained neural network of the aforementioned tweets needed to be downloaded programmatically from the Udacity website and cleaned as required. 

The tasks for this project were:
• Data wrangling.
which consisted of: 1- Gathering data
                    2- Assessing data 
                    3- Cleaning data 
• Storing, analyzing, and visualizing the wrangled data
• Reporting
